## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of UIR Framework seriously. If you believe you
have found a security vulnerability in our project, please report it to
us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub 
issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to:
- **Email**: aansh@briefcasebrain.com
- **Subject Line**: [SECURITY] UIR Framework - Brief description

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you
do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original
message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site
scripting, authentication bypass, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the
issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct
URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the
issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. **Confirm the problem** and determine the affected versions
2. **Audit code** to find any potential similar problems
3. **Prepare fixes** for all releases still under maintenance
4. **Release patches** as soon as possible

We will coordinate the disclosure of the vulnerability with you. We
prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as a fix is
available. Typically, we aim to release patches within 7 days of a
confirmed vulnerability.

## Security Best Practices

When using UIR Framework, please follow these security best practices:

### API Keys and Credentials

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- Store credentials in environment variables or secure vaults
- Use different credentials for development and production
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Implement least-privilege access controls

### Input Validation

- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use parameterized queries when interfacing with databases
- Implement proper rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate file uploads and limit file sizes

### Network Security

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use secure WebSocket connections (WSS) when applicable
- Keep TLS/SSL certificates up to date

### Dependencies

- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- Use `pip audit` or similar tools to scan for vulnerable packages
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Review dependency licenses and security advisories

### Deployment Security

- Keep the framework and all dependencies up to date
- Use container scanning tools if deploying with Docker
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use secrets management systems for sensitive configuration
- Enable audit logging for all API access
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Security Features

UIR Framework includes several built-in security features:

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API key management with scoping
- Session management with timeout controls

### Rate Limiting

- Configurable rate limits per endpoint
- Per-user and per-IP rate limiting
- Token bucket algorithm for fair usage

### Data Protection

- Automatic input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection in API responses
- Secure password hashing (when applicable)

### Monitoring & Auditing

- Comprehensive audit logging
- Failed authentication tracking
- Anomaly detection capabilities
- Integration with security monitoring tools

## Known Security Considerations

### Third-Party Providers

When using external search providers (Google, Bing, etc.):
- API keys may be exposed in client-side requests if not properly
proxied
- Search results may contain malicious content
- Provider rate limits may be used for DoS attacks

**Mitigation**: Always proxy requests through your backend and
implement proper sanitization.

### Vector Database Security

When using vector databases:
- Embedding data may contain sensitive information
- Similarity searches may reveal private data patterns
- Vector injection attacks are possible

**Mitigation**: Implement proper access controls and data segregation.

### Cache Poisoning

The caching layer may be vulnerable to cache poisoning attacks if not
properly configured.

**Mitigation**: Validate cache keys, implement cache segmentation, and
use signed cache entries.

## Compliance

UIR Framework is designed to help you meet common compliance
requirements:

- **GDPR**: Supports data deletion and user consent management
- **CCPA**: Provides data export and deletion capabilities
- **SOC 2**: Includes audit logging and access controls
- **HIPAA**: Can be configured for healthcare data (with proper
implementation)

Note: Compliance is a shared responsibility. While UIR Framework
provides tools and features to help meet compliance requirements,
proper implementation and configuration are essential.

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as soon as possible after a vulnerability
is confirmed. We recommend:

1. Subscribe to our security mailing list
2. Watch the GitHub repository for security advisories
3. Enable Dependabot alerts on your fork
4. Regularly check for updates using `pip list --outdated`
